[notes to grader]
Assignment 0 is currently not working because I might have accidentally deleted
    an important stache file while working on assignment 1. However, I have the 
    vectorTests.html with my score from before. It was working before I started
    working on this assignment. Please give me some time to fix it as of right
    now. Thank you,
